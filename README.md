  ## Description

  This is a simple README.md file generator created using Node.js and the inquirer npm package. It streamlines the process of creating a high-quality README file for your projects by prompting you for information and then generating a structured README with sections such as Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

  ## Installation

  Make sure you have nodejs installed on your machine.

  ## Usage

  Answer the prompts to provide information about your project. Once all prompts are completed, the generator will create a README.md file in the project's root directory.
